# Provably Fair Verification - Lofi Library

This game uses an industry-standard SHA-256 hashing algorithm to ensure that every spin result is predetermined and verifiable.

## 1. The Hashing Input
Each cell's symbol is determined by a string composed of:
`[ServerSeed]-[ClientSeed]-[Nonce]-[CellIndex]`

- **Server Seed:** A cryptographically secure random string generated by the house.
- **Client Seed:** A player-provided string to ensure the house cannot predict the outcome.
- **Nonce:** The number of spins played in the current session.
- **Cell Index:** The specific position (0-24) on the 5x5 grid.

## 2. Verification Steps
Players can verify any past result using the following logic:
1. Combine the Seeds, Nonce, and Index into the message string.
2. Run the string through a SHA-256 hasher.
3. Take the first 8 characters of the resulting hex string and convert them to an integer.
4. Use `Integer % SymbolPoolSize` to find the corresponding symbol in the weighted pool.

## 3. Mathematical Integrity
- **Target RTP:** 96.45%
- **Hit Frequency:** Calculated based on 5+ symbol clusters.
- **Weights:** Symbols are weighted from 'Cabin' (Rare/High Value) to 'Candle' (Common/Low Value).
